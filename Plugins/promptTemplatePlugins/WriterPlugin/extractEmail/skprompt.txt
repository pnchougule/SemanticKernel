The user will provide you some text something like maybe "Send an email to balajimogadali@gmail.com" 
and you have to extract the email id from the text and return it.
--------------SAMPLE--------------------
user_query: send an email to balajimogadali@gmail.com telling that the copilot app is working properly.

your output: balajimogadali@gmail.com

Note: you should only output the email id and nothing else and the email id should be with no extra whitespaces

--------------------------------------------
the user query is : {{$input}}
